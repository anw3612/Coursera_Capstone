    "One of the things that Kansas City is most well known for is their distinct barbecue style - a variety of different meats that are slow smoked and coated in a thick tomato based sauce.  If you ask a Kansas City local what their favorite barbecue restaurant is, you are likely to hear a variety of answers.  There are many different restaurants located around the metropolitan area, and each one has a slightly different take on the style than the others.  However, as the Kansas City metropolitan area continues to grow, there will be additional opportunities for new BBQ restaurants to start up.  The biggest challenges that a new BBQ restaurant would face is standing out within the Kansas City area, and a good location is one of the best ways to address this challenge.  This report is an attempt to help future business developers decide where in Kansas City a new BBQ venue could be placed successfully. \n",
    "\n",
    "The major factors we will use to determine the optimal location of a new BBQ restaurant are the following:\n",
    "1. How many additional BBQ restaurants are within the region of Kansas City?\n",
    "2. How many restaurants in total are already located within the region of Kansas City?\n",
    "3. How many people live in this region of Kansas City?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ultimate goal is to find a location that is well populated, but that also isn't completely developed with too many restaurants and especially restaurants that would be a direct competitor with the new venue that is being planned.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By using data science techniques, we will analyze the neighborhoods of the Kansas City metropolitan area on the criteria given above.  Then, based on these criteria, we will make some recommendations of potential locations that the new BBQ restaurant could be placed into, with the positives and negatives of each potential location considered."

There is also overlap between some of the larger Kansas suburbs:  Overland Park, Prarie Village, and Leawood.  Finally, there is a rather large circle surrounding Leavenworth, Kansas.  This is due to the relatively large distance between it and Kansas City.  In reality, we should not have such a large area representing the municipality.  Let's manually shrink the radius to better fit the city, and see what the results look like."
